# PeoplePerson Project Plan

## Overall Strategy

**Do not fuss with productionizing or improving the GUI. Just deploy this to the cloud and try to start using it.**

## Current Status
- ✅ Authentication system working (Firebase + emulator)
- ✅ FastAPI backend functional
- ✅ React frontend operational
- ✅ Basic CRUD operations for people management
- ⚠️ Security leak needs immediate attention (Issue #002)

## Priority Order

### 1. IMMEDIATE: Security (Issue #002)
- Fix exposed Google API key
- Secure Firebase configuration
- Move secrets to environment variables

### 2. NEXT: Cloud Deployment (Issue #001)
- Deploy to Google Cloud as-is
- Get it running in production
- Start using the application with real data

### 3. LATER: Improvements (Future)
- UI/UX enhancements
- Feature additions
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced productionization

## Key Principles

1. **Ship over perfect** - Get the working application deployed and usable
2. **Security first** - Address security issues immediately
3. **Minimal viable deployment** - Don't over-engineer the initial cloud setup
4. **Learn by using** - Deploy and use the app to understand real needs
5. **Iterate based on usage** - Improve based on actual user experience

## Success Definition
The plan is successful when:
- Application is securely deployed to the cloud
- Authentication works in production
- You can successfully manage people/contacts through the web interface
- Real usage provides insights for future improvements

*Remember: The goal is to get this deployed and start using it, not to build the perfect application.*
