# Issue #001: Set Up Google Cloud

## Overview
Set up Google Cloud Platform infrastructure to support production deployment of PeoplePerson application.

## Current State
- Application running locally with Firebase emulator
- FastAPI backend with SQLite database
- React frontend with FirebaseUI authentication
- All services working in development environment

## Objectives
1. Set up Google Cloud Project
2. Configure Firebase for production
3. Set up Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) database
4. Configure Google Cloud Run for FastAPI backend
5. Set up Firebase Hosting for React frontend
6. Configure proper authentication flow for production
7. Set up monitoring and logging

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Google Cloud Foundation
- [ ] Create Google Cloud Project
- [ ] Enable required APIs (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Firebase, etc.)
- [ ] Set up billing and resource quotas
- [ ] Configure IAM roles and service accounts

### Phase 2: Database Setup
- [ ] Create Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance
- [ ] Configure database security and networking
- [ ] Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Set up database migrations
- [ ] Configure connection pooling

### Phase 3: Backend Deployment
- [ ] Containerize FastAPI application
- [ ] Deploy to Google Cloud Run
- [ ] Configure environment variables and secrets
- [ ] Set up custom domain and SSL
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling policies

### Phase 4: Frontend Deployment
- [ ] Build React application for production
- [ ] Deploy to Firebase Hosting
- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [ ] Set up CDN and caching policies

### Phase 5: Authentication & Security
- [ ] Configure Firebase Authentication for production
- [ ] Set up proper CORS policies
- [ ] Configure Firebase service account for backend
- [ ] Implement proper secret management
- [ ] Set up security headers and policies

### Phase 6: Monitoring & Operations
- [ ] Set up Google Cloud Monitoring
- [ ] Configure logging and alerting
- [ ] Set up error tracking
- [ ] Implement health checks
- [ ] Configure backup strategies

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Production application accessible via custom domain
- [ ] Authentication working end-to-end in production
- [ ] Database properly configured and secured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline ready for future deployments

## Technical Requirements
- Google Cloud Project with appropriate quotas
- Custom domain name
- SSL certificates
- Firebase project configured for production
- PostgreSQL database instance
- Container registry for backend images

## Timeline
- Phase 1-2: 1-2 days (Foundation & Database)
- Phase 3-4: 2-3 days (Deployments)
- Phase 5-6: 1-2 days (Security & Operations)
- **Total Estimated Time: 4-7 days**

## Dependencies
- Google Cloud account with billing enabled
- Domain name registration
- Firebase project ownership
- Production environment variables and secrets

## Notes
- Start with minimal viable production setup
- Can iterate and improve after initial deployment
- Focus on security and proper authentication setup
- Document all configuration for team knowledge sharing
