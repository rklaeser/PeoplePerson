It was that I felt like I needed to run back to Jordan so that she wouldn't be jealous. I think I'm afraid that if I talk to Kiara, I will come to the realization that Jordan and I need to break up.",

I think that what Jordan doesn't like about my relationship with Kiara is because I actually spend far less time than Chloe does with her guy friend.

Halle didn't seem to like Jordan, and I wonder if Halle is picking up on something I'm not seeing. Then there was dinner with Carly and Chase. I thought it went okay, but Jordan didn't like when conversations broke off (Carly talking to me, Jordan talking to Chase). Carly definitely doesn't like Jordan - when we got pizza, she asked something like 'Why are you still with her?' Angie said the same thing - first thing she said to me. I understand that I haven't seen you guys, and that's directly or indirectly attributed to Jordan. But what you guys haven't seen is how good the relationship has been for me - how I've addressed things I've been avoiding, like my health and job search. Jordan hasn't been saying 'Reed, you need to do these things' - she's helped me find the confidence to escape a funk.",

What I was really trying to do was respond to the fact that we had just spent the last three weeks together every day. I was thinking it could be healthy to have a day now and then just to reflect on your own. That would be a big part of not losing the I in the relationship - which is actually a phrase she says: 'find the we without losing the I.' I want to try and have this conversation again and propose that at some cadence, we spend the night on our own and just use that space as we will.
